**Project Overview: Student Database API with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL**

This project is a RESTful API built with Spring Boot that manages a student database using JPA (Java Persistence API) for ORM and PostgreSQL as the database. 

The API allows for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student entities, including attributes such as name, email, date of birth, and age. 

The project demonstrates core concepts of Spring Boot, including dependency injection, service layers, and data persistence, while offering a robust and scalable backend solution for managing student information.
